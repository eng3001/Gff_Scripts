# Gff_Scripts 
***Author:*** Wyatt Eng

***Goal:*** A collection of scripts to manipulate or reformat gff files.

All script are designed to be used on a functionally annotated genome. I used Braker2, InterProScan, and UniProt Databases.

### Files:
Add_Gff_Note_To_Fasta.py : This script adds the "Note" section of a gff file into the fasta header.
IGV_Compatable_Gff_Note.py : This script edits the "Note" section of the gff file into IGV compatable format. Turns "Note" section into a single string.
Change_Contig_Name_FA_and_Gff.py : Script changes the genome fasta header to a user defined header. Gff scaffold names are changed accordingly.
